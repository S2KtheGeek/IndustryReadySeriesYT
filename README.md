The Shared Contents are coagulated here

Hey Guys, 
I am currently learning data science and machine learning, and I would like to share my learning experiences and my journey with you guys. In the upcoming series, we will be talking about the core requirements and skills you need to learn and apply if you wish to become a part of the profession which Harvard Business School named as the “Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”. 

I am aware that there are hundreds of “tutorial” like series out there on Youtube, and you might be wondering why do another one at all? Majority of the courses and tutorials are not exactly geared towards complete beginners and newcomers to the field, and the amount of things to know and learn about is just huge. So I decided to streamline it all for you with the help of my friend Debayan who is already working in the industry and can tell us what we actually need to learn about. 

So I and Debayan are gonna streamline it for you guys….
